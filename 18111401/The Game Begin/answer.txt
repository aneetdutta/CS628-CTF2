1. In the problem we are asked to find the password corresponding to my username.
2. So, in the login page we tried to run different commands in the password field.
3. At first, when I have done SQL injection in the password field using the command:  %'or '0'='0
4. This allowed me to login to the server but I landed up in someone else's account(Naman Narang).
5. This made me sure that password field in the login page is vulnerable to sql injection and is the correct place to do sql injection, but I have to write my query corresponding to my email.
6. SQL command similar to the previous one is injected, but a constraint about my email is mentioned in the sql query which allowed me to login to my account and the flag is present in the bio.
Command: %'or email='aneetk@iitk.ac.in
