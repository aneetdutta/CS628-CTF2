if(Checking for Two Arguments)

      if(MD5({Secret-Salt} + Argument_1) == MD5({Secret-Salt} + Argument_2))

      else
        Print "Try Harder !";

1. The code snippet is visible in the webpage which makes it clear that we have to satisfy two if conditions to get the flag.
2. There can be two approach to solve this problem:
	a) Find two different arguments such that MD5({Secret-Salt} + Argument_1) == MD5({Secret-Salt} + Argument_2).
	b) Setting both arguments to be same but bypassing the condition if(Argument_1 != Argument_2). 
3. I have followed the second approach because the secret salt is unknown to me.
4. The problem in php is that when concatenating two strings like  echo "secret".array(); and echo "secret".array("x", "y", "z"); will be same, i.e secretArray.
5. It just acts as if it was just the string “Array”. Therefore, we can get the same string with two different arrays and bypass the equality check.
6. Therefore, introducing array symbol in the argument bypassed the equality check and the flag is received.
